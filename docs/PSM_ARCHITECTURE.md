> **2026-07-10 note:** this document was written before T24 (Tier B's bonding curve moved off Midnight entirely, onto Cardano/Aiken), T25 (Tier C's Eligibility Gate + DarkVeil + Bonding Curve merged into one Compact contract — Compact has no cross-contract call mechanism, confirmed by compiling real probe contracts), and the T29/T30/T48/T49/T13 wave of failure-path and graduation work. The sections below have been corrected to match the real, current, compiled contracts — not just re-described from memory. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** is the more actively maintained visual reference; this document goes deeper on rationale and math that hasn't changed (privacy model, identity system, DarkVeil commitment scheme, bonding curve formulas) and has been corrected everywhere it previously described a mechanism that turned out not to exist or has since been replaced.

> **2026-07-22 note:** not deeply re-audited this pass — `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, and `architecture.html` were the ones brought current (Tier A's real Preprod proof, T92-T117's security-audit passes, the new `cto_sybil_challenge.ak` validator, Staking's real UI). The rationale/math sections here (privacy model, identity system, DarkVeil commitment scheme, bonding curve formulas) are believed still accurate since that content genuinely hasn't changed, but this file — like the other three — needs a real update pass whenever a major architectural fact changes, not just when someone notices it's stale.

## 1. Executive Summary

Noctis is a privacy-first token launchpad that operates across two blockchain layers:

- **Cardano L1** — public bonding curves, LP escrow, CTO governance (Aiken smart contracts)
- **Midnight Network** — private pre-sale (DarkVeil), eligibility verification, ZK proof generation (Compact PSM contracts)

The protocol offers three launch tiers (A: Cardano-only, B: Cardano+DarkVeil, C: fully Midnight-native), each addressing different creator needs for privacy, cost, and complexity.

The core innovation is **DarkVeil** — a zero-knowledge private buying phase where participants prove eligibility without revealing identity, wallet balance, or purchase amount. This eliminates front-running, whale advantage, and copy-trading during the most vulnerable phase of a token launch.

---

## 2. System Topology

> **Corrected 2026-07-10.** The original diagram showed one generic "Bond Curve" box shared by Tier B/C on Midnight. Since T24, Tier B's bonding curve is a Cardano/Aiken contract — the public phase never touches Midnight. Since T25, Tier C's bonding curve is merged with its Eligibility Gate and DarkVeil PSM into a single deployed Compact contract (Compact has no cross-contract call mechanism, so this is the only way the 5% cap can be enforced against one shared ledger across DarkVeil + public phases). The diagram below is per-tier rather than one shared box.

Shared Midnight PSMs used by both Tier B and Tier C, unaffected by the T24/T25 split: **Creator Escrow PSM** (real fee accrual for Tier C only — Tier B's real ADA fee accrues on the Cardano curve contract instead, T46) and **Treasury PSM** (platform's 0.6% fee accumulation, currency-split ADA/NIGHT ledger since T6).

## 3. Three-Tier Model

### Tier A — Cardano Only

**Target:** Simple launches that don't need privacy. Community tokens, meme coins, public fundraises.

**Flow:**
1. Creator configures launch on noctis.zone wizard
2. Bonding curve deploys on Cardano (Aiken)
3. Public buys phase — linear curve, 5% soft cap
4. Graduation → LP seeded to Cardano DEX
5. LP locked in Cardano LP Escrow (365 days, no withdraw)

**Privacy:** None. All transactions visible on Cardano L1.

### Tier B — Cardano + DarkVeil

**Target:** Projects that need front-run protection for early supporters but want public price discovery afterward.

**Flow (corrected 2026-07-10, T24; DarkVeil settlement corrected 2026-07-11, T46):**
1. Creator configures launch, selects DarkVeil allocation (10-20%)
2. Eligibility Gate + DarkVeil deploy together as ONE Midnight contract (Phase 2, 2026-07-11 — `eligibility_gate.compact`; the old standalone `darkveil.compact` was deleted, superseded)
3. Participants register on Midnight (lock NIGHT bond, prove allowlist membership)
4. DarkVeil buying phase — commitment-based private purchases (`submitBuyCommit`/`revealBuyCommit`) record the buyer's private intent; NO ADA moves here — Compact can't custody ADA (no bridge exists). Real settlement happens after close, in step 8.
5. DarkVeil closes → ZK Fair Launch Certificate generated; relayer also anchors a `dv_allocation_root` — a Merkle root over each registrant's private `(vkh, amount, salt)` allocation, NOT a plaintext list (T46 — the original design published every registrant's amount at deploy time, violating the certificate's own "Private forever: Individual buy amounts" promise)
6. Certificate + allocation root pushed to Cardano (Aiken ZK Anchor contract)
7. Buyers claim their DarkVeil allocation on Cardano via `ClaimDarkVeilTokens` (T46) — presenting their own privately-known `(dv_amount, salt, merkle_proof)`, paying the flat DarkVeil price in real ADA, receiving their tokens. Nobody's allocation is visible unless and until that specific wallet claims.
8. **Public bonding curve runs on Cardano L1, not Midnight** — `contracts/cardano/bonding_curve_tier_b.ak` (quadratic, priced in ADA). The cumulative 5% cap list starts EMPTY and gains an entry per wallet only once that wallet transacts (claims its DV allocation in step 7, or buys publicly here). Tokens mint directly to the buyer on each purchase — no separate cross-chain distribution step, since token and payment are already in the same place.
9. Graduation (100% sell-through) → `Graduate`/`SealLock` (T49, permissionless, verified by real value movement) → LP seeded to Cardano DEX → LP Escrow (365 days, `lp_escrow.ak`, whitelist governed by T30's multisig + 72h notice)

**Privacy:** High. DarkVeil registration/commit/reveal is fully private (Midnight); nobody's allocation amount is ever published unless and until they choose to claim it. Public curve phase is a normal, visible Cardano transaction, same as any claim.

**Creator fees are ONE balance for Tier B, not a two-stream split (T46 supersedes T45):** T45 (2026-07-10) originally described "Stream A1" (Midnight, DarkVeil-phase) and "Stream A2" (Cardano, public-phase) as two independently-claimed balances. Investigating T46 found Stream A1 was never mechanically real — Compact could never enforce the ADA payment it would have required. With DarkVeil purchases now settling on Cardano too, ALL Tier B creator fees accrue in one place: `bonding_curve_tier_b.ak`'s own `creator_fees_accrued`, claimed via that contract's `ClaimCreatorFees` — same self-contained pattern as Tier A. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)'s Creator Fee Escrow section.

### Tier C — Midnight + DarkVeil

**Target:** Maximum privacy launches. Tokens that live entirely on Midnight.

**Flow (corrected 2026-07-10, T25):**
1. Creator configures launch (priced in NIGHT)
2. Eligibility Gate + DarkVeil + Bonding Curve are compiled and deployed as **one merged Compact contract** (`bonding_curve.compact`, despite the filename) sharing a single `cumulativePurchases` ledger — Compact has no working cross-contract call mechanism (every call form tested against the real compiler fails), so this compile-time merge is the only way the 5% cap can be enforced atomically across both DarkVeil and public-phase purchases. Creator Escrow, Treasury, and Midnight LP Escrow remain separate PSMs.
3. DarkVeil phase (registration, NIGHT bond, commitment-based private buying — `revealBuyCommit` now enforces real payment via `receiveUnshielded` at reveal time, T25)
4. Bonding curve public phase inside the same merged contract (quadratic, priced in NIGHT)
5. Graduation → LP seeded to Midnight LP Escrow PSM (DEX-agnostic pending T18 — Option C, "redefine graduation," is the current default: LP sits in escrow until a Midnight DEX is designated)
6. LP Escrow on Midnight (365 days, no withdraw, DEX migration once a Midnight DEX exists)
7. ZK Fair Launch Certificate relayed to Cardano — Option B (platform relayer), not Option A, since no real Midnight SDK primitive can post directly to Cardano L1 (T21, confirmed 2026-07-10)

**Privacy:** Maximum. Everything except the certificate is private.

**Build status:** Blocked on Midnight DEX availability (see internal tracking T17-T21).

## 4. Midnight PSM Architecture

### PSM Overview

A **Private State Machine (PSM)** is Midnight's equivalent of a smart contract. Each PSM maintains private ledger state that can only be modified through authorized circuits. State changes require zero-knowledge proofs that validate the transition without revealing private inputs.

### The Noctis PSMs — Shape Differs By Tier (corrected 2026-07-10, T24/T25)

There is no longer one fixed set of "six PSMs" shared identically across tiers. What each contract *is* depends on which tier it's serving:

- **Tier B:** Eligibility Gate and DarkVeil are **merged into one deployed contract** (`eligibility_gate.compact`, Phase 2 2026-07-11 — the old standalone `darkveil.compact` was deleted) — it only ever handles the DarkVeil phase. There is no Midnight Bonding Curve PSM for Tier B at all; the public curve, AND the real settlement of a DarkVeil purchase (ADA payment + token delivery via `ClaimDarkVeilTokens`), live in `contracts/cardano/bonding_curve_tier_b.ak` on Cardano (T24, T46).
- **Tier C:** Eligibility Gate, DarkVeil, and Bonding Curve are **merged into one deployed contract** (`bonding_curve.compact`) sharing one cap ledger (T25) — described separately below as 4.2.
- **Both tiers:** Creator Escrow PSM (4.4), Treasury PSM (4.5) are standalone in shape — but Tier B's Creator Escrow never actually accrues a real fee (T46): Compact could never enforce Tier B's ADA payment, so all Tier B creator fees accrue on the Cardano curve contract instead.
- **Tier C only:** Midnight LP Escrow PSM (4.6) — Tier A and B both use the Cardano `lp_escrow.ak` contract instead; there is no Midnight LP Escrow PSM for Tier B.

The subsections below describe each contract's real current circuits. 4.1–4.3 describe Tier B's merged shape; the T25 box afterward describes Tier C's merged shape.

#### 4.1 Eligibility Gate PSM (Tier B — merged with the former DarkVeil PSM, Phase 2 2026-07-11)

**Purpose:** Gate entry to DarkVeil (allowlist + 5% cumulative cap) **and** run the whole DarkVeil private-buying phase (registration, NIGHT bonds, commitment/reveal, bond refunds, ZK Fair Launch Certificate) for Tier B, all in one deployed contract.

**Correction (2026-07-12):** an earlier version of this document described "Eligibility Gate" and "DarkVeil" as two separate contracts (see the old 4.3 below, now removed). They were merged into one file, `eligibility_gate.compact`, during the Phase 2 security pass (2026-07-11) — the old standalone `darkveil.compact` was deleted entirely. This wasn't a renaming; it closed a real gap: Compact has no cross-contract call mechanism, so two separate contracts could never have enforced one shared cumulative cap across both DarkVeil and (for Tier B) the public phase without merging. Real Tier B settlement (ADA payment + token delivery for a DarkVeil purchase) does **not** happen in this contract at all — it happens on Cardano via `bonding_curve_tier_b.ak`'s `ClaimDarkVeilTokens` (T46), since ADA isn't representable as a Midnight-native token.

**State (merged contract):**
- `launchId` (sealed), `allowlistRoot` (sealed), `walletCap` (sealed) — 5% of supply, precomputed
- `bondAmount` (sealed) — NIGHT bond required for registration ($50 USD equivalent, fixed at lockup)
- `phase`/`dvState` — launch phase and DarkVeil sub-phase (Registration, Buying, Closed, Cancelled)
- `registrationNullifiers`, `buyNullifiers` — sets preventing double-registration/double-buying
- `cumulativePurchases` — map of `UserPublicKey` → total purchased (shared across DarkVeil + any Tier B public-phase entry that references this identity)
- `dvTokensPurchased` — DarkVeil-only purchases, tracked separately for the ratio-based bond refund
- `lockedBonds` — map of buyer key → locked NIGHT bond amount
- `baseSlot` — flat per-registrant allocation, set once at DarkVeil close
- `hasClaimableBalance`-style governor-attested facts do **not** live here — that's `cto_governance.compact`, see 4.6
- `creatorKey` (sealed, T32 wash-trading block), `treasuryAddr`/`opsAddr` (sealed, real unshielded addresses)
- `governorKey` (sealed)

**Circuits (current, real):**
1. `registerForDarkVeil(bondCommitment)` — verify allowlist membership (ZK proof of Merkle membership, leaf derived in-circuit from caller identity, not a free witness — T57 fix), lock the NIGHT bond via `receiveUnshielded`, reject the creator's own identity (T32), emit registration nullifier
2. `submitBuyCommit(commitment)` — submit a private buy commitment; **requires proof of prior registration** (recomputes the caller's own registration nullifier and checks membership in `registrationNullifiers` — T51 fix, closed a real gap where any wallet could buy without ever registering)
3. `revealBuyCommit(...)` — reveal after close; enforces the `baseSlot` per-registrant cap, so no single registrant can take more than their allocation
4. `claimBondRefund(recipientAddr)` — full NIGHT bond refund for the "DarkVeil failed, <50% participation" case; pays out for real via `sendUnshielded` (was ledger-only before the Phase 2 fix, T60)
5. `claimRatioBondRefund(recipientAddr, claimedRefund, claimedTreasuryShare)` — ratio-based partial refund for a normal close (`NIGHT_returned = bonded × purchased/baseSlot`), ported from Tier C's formula (T43/T33) during the same merge that added this contract's registration+buying logic (T63) — pays the buyer their share and routes the forfeited remainder 60/40 treasury/ops directly via `sendUnshielded`
6. `closeDarkVeil(...)` / phase-advance circuits — governor-gated DarkVeil lifecycle
7. Read circuits: `getFairLaunchCert`, `getDvState`, `getCumulativePurchase`, etc.

**Note:** `checkAndUpdateCap` — a standalone cap-checking circuit described in earlier documentation — no longer exists. Cap enforcement is inline, folded directly into the buy/reveal path, so the cap cannot be manipulated independently of an actual purchase. If you see it referenced elsewhere, that reference is stale.

#### 4.2 Bonding Curve PSM (Tier C only — merged with Eligibility Gate + DarkVeil, T25)

**Purpose:** Quadratic price discovery, NIGHT-denominated, for **Tier C only**. Tier A uses a linear Aiken contract on Cardano L1 (`contracts/cardano/bonding_curve.ak`); Tier B uses a quadratic Aiken contract on Cardano L1 (`contracts/cardano/bonding_curve_tier_b.ak`, T24). Neither Tier A nor Tier B has a Midnight-side bonding curve anymore — see Section 10 for the curve-shape rationale.

**Corrected 2026-07-10 (T25):** this is not a standalone contract. `contracts/midnight/bonding_curve.compact` is the **merged** deployment for Tier C — it contains the Eligibility Gate's cap-tracking logic, the DarkVeil phase's registration/commitment/reveal logic, and the public-phase buying logic, all sharing one `cumulativePurchases` ledger. This was forced by a real constraint: Compact has no working cross-contract call mechanism (verified against the compiler — every call form tested fails with "contract types are not yet implemented"), so three separate PSMs calling each other to enforce one shared 5% cap was never achievable. The file keeps the name `bonding_curve.compact` for historical reasons, but functionally it is Tier C's entire Midnight-side launch contract.

**State (merged contract, Tier C):**
- `launchId` (sealed), `basePrice` (sealed), `maxPrice` (sealed), `curveSupply` (sealed), `dvAllocation`/`dvPrice`/`bondAmount` (sealed, DarkVeil params), `creatorPubKey` (sealed, T32 wash-trading block)
- `curveState` — Inactive, Active, Graduated, Cancelled, Expired (T29)
- `dvState` — Registration, Buying, Closed (DarkVeil sub-phase, tracked in the same contract)
- `cumulativePurchases` — **single shared map**, buyer key → total purchased across DarkVeil + public phases (the cap enforcement this whole merge exists for)
- `dvTokensPurchased` — DarkVeil-only purchases, tracked separately for the ratio-based bond refund (T43)
- `tokensSold`, `totalRaised` — Public counters
- `feeConfig` (sealed) — Fee split (100/60/40 bps)
- `creatorFees`, `treasuryFees`, `opsFees` — Fee accumulators
- `governorKey` (sealed)

**Circuits (merged contract, selected):**
1. `registerForDarkVeil(merkleProof, nullifier)` — DarkVeil registration, same eligibility checks as Tier B's standalone gate, now checking/updating the shared cap map
2. `revealBuyCommit(commitment, tokenAmount, pricePerToken)` — DarkVeil reveal; enforces real NIGHT payment via `receiveUnshielded` at reveal time (T25 fix — this circuit previously had zero payment enforcement)
3. `buyTokens(tokenAmount, claimedPrice, grossPayment, claimedCreatorFee, claimedTreasuryFee, claimedOpsFee, timestamp)` — public-phase buy; caller supplies price/fee-split values, circuit verifies via cross-multiplication (no division in-circuit); rejects the creator's own `creatorPubKey` (T32)
4. `claimRatioBondRefund(claimedRefund)` — T43/T33: pays out `NIGHT_bonded × (tokens_purchased/tokens_allocated)` to the buyer, plus routes the forfeited remainder directly to fixed treasury/ops addresses (60/40) via `sendUnshielded` — no cross-contract call needed since destinations are fixed real addresses
5. `claimBondRefund` — pre-existing full-refund path for the "DarkVeil failed, <50% participation" case
6. `ExpireCurve`-equivalent / `activateCurve` / `cancelCurve` — lifecycle, same permissionless-after-deadline idiom as the Aiken contracts (T29)
7. `currentPrice`, `tokensRemaining`, `balanceOf`, `getFairLaunchCert` — read circuits

#### 4.3 Creator Escrow PSM (Stream A bonding-curve fee escrow ONLY — no vesting)

**Purpose:** originally designed to hold the creator's 1.0% bonding-curve fee escrow (Stream A) and pay it out monthly. Vesting was split out into its own contract, `vesting.compact` (2026-07-09) — mixing day-based vesting math with a growing fee accumulator was a real bug (`claimAmount * vestDays == escrowAmount * elapsedDays` breaks once `escrowAmount` keeps changing under an in-progress claim), not just mislabeling.

**Important correction (T51, 2026-07-12): this contract never actually holds a real fee for either tier in the current architecture.** Tier B's Stream A fee accrues directly on the Cardano curve contract (`bonding_curve_tier_b.ak`, since real Tier B settlement moved to Cardano entirely, T46). Tier C's accrues inline in `bonding_curve.compact`'s own `creatorFees` ledger field. `depositFees` here is real, tested, and correctly gated — it is simply never invoked by anything in the shipped design (and couldn't be, even if it wanted to — Compact has no cross-contract call mechanism, T2/T25).

**State:**
- `launchId` (sealed), `creatorKey` (sealed), `currency` (sealed — Ada or Night, matches the launch's own curve currency)
- `escrowAmount`, `escrowState` (Active, Closed, FullyClaimed, CTORedirected, Cancelled), `claimedAmount`
- `ctoTriggered`, `communityWallet` — CTO redirect state (T51, mirrors the pattern every curve contract now uses)
- `lastClaimTimestamp` — for silence-lock monitoring (see the important note below)
- `postCtoFees`, `communityClaimedAmount`
- `governorKey` (sealed)

**Circuits:**
1. `closeEscrowAtGraduation(graduationTimestamp)` — fixes the final escrow total, establishes the silence-lock clock baseline (only starts once there's an actual claimable balance, not from deploy — T36 note below)
2. `claimFees(claimAmount, currentTimestamp)` — creator's monthly claim; pays out for real via `sendUnshielded` for NIGHT-currency escrows (Phase 1 fix, ) — ADA-currency escrows stay ledger-only (ADA isn't Midnight-native)
3. `triggerCTO`/`dissolveCTO` — redirects future claims to the community wallet after a passed CTO vote
4. `depositFees(amount)` — real, tested, but never actually invoked (see above)
5. `claimByCommunity`/`claimRemainingEscrowByCommunity` — post-CTO claim path
6. `checkCreatorSilence(currentTimestamp)` — checks `lastClaimTimestamp` against a 90-day threshold

**Important note on the silence lock:** this contract's own `checkCreatorSilence`/`lastClaimTimestamp` are vestigial for the same reason as its fee accrual — since no real claims happen here for either tier post-T46, this timestamp never meaningfully updates. The **actual, currently-enforced** silence-lock gate for triggering a CTO vote lives in `cto_governance.compact`'s `createProposal` (`lastCreatorActivity`/`silenceThreshold`, plus the T36 `hasClaimableBalance` gate — see 4.6). Don't assume this contract's silence check is the one that matters.

#### 4.4 Vesting PSM (creator TOKEN allocation only — split from Creator Escrow, 2026-07-09)

**Purpose:** Linear release of the creator's token allocation (90-365 days, no default) — genuinely separate from Creator Escrow's fee income, per CLAUDE.md's explicit "two distinct income streams, never conflate them" principle.

**State:**
- `launchId` (sealed), `creatorKey` (sealed), `vestDays` (sealed), `tokenAllocation` (sealed — fixed at deploy, never touched by fee deposits, unlike the old merged design)
- `vestState`, `claimedAmount`, `vestStartTimestamp`
- `ctoTriggered`, `communityWallet` — same CTO pattern as every other PSM (T51)
- `governorKey` (sealed)

**Circuits:**
1. `startVesting(startTimestamp)` — governor triggers vesting start; **timestamp now bound to real chain time** via `blockTimeGte`/`blockTimeLte` (±1 hour tolerance) rather than trusted outright (T50 fix — before this, a compromised governor or the creator themself could forge an old start timestamp to unlock vested tokens early)
2. `claimVested(claimAmount, currentTimestamp)` — creator claims vested portion; same real chain-time binding applies (T50 — before this, the creator could supply a future timestamp and claim 100% on day one)
3. `triggerCTO`/`dissolveCTO` — unvested tokens freeze and redirect to the community wallet after a passed CTO vote (not burned)
4. `cancelLaunch` — pre-graduation cancellation path

**Key constraint:** `vestDays` must be 90-365. No default. Creator must actively choose at launch wizard. No tokens release before graduation regardless of elapsed time.

#### 4.5 Treasury PSM

**Purpose:** Accumulate platform fees (0.6% of each trade), track the ADA-equivalent floor for pausing new Tier B/C launches.

**Corrected 2026-07-10 (T6) — real bug found while building the floor check:** `treasuryBalance` used to sum ADA-denominated and NIGHT-denominated deposits into one meaningless combined number (1000 lovelace + 1000 NIGHT atomic units became "2000," with no real meaning). Split into `adaBalance`/`nightBalance` (and their lifetime-counter equivalents) so a floor check is actually computable.

**State:**
- `launchId` (sealed), `governorKey` (sealed)
- `adaBalance`, `nightBalance` — split since T6, plus `totalAdaFeesCollected`/`totalNightFeesCollected`
- `floorLovelace`/`warningLovelace` (sealed) — T6 floor/warning thresholds
- `withdrawalCount`

**Circuits:**
1. `depositFees(amount, currency)` — deposit fees; for NIGHT this requires a real matching unshielded input via `receiveUnshielded` (requires a real matching input, so the recorded balance always corresponds to value actually received)
2. `withdrawFees(amount, currency, recipientAddr)` — governor withdraws for stablecoin conversion; NIGHT withdrawals now pay out for real via `sendUnshielded` (T6 fix — was ledger-only before)
3. `getAdaBalance`/`getNightBalance` — read per-currency balances
4. `getAdaEquivalentBalance(nightPriceLovelacePerAtomicUnit)`/`isBelowFloor(...)`/`isBelowWarning(...)` — T6's mark-to-market circuits; multiplication only, no on-chain division (the NIGHT/lovelace rate is computed off-chain from the Oracle Strategy and passed in). These are advisory read-only queries, not an on-chain launch-creation gate — this PSM has no "create launch" circuit to attach a block to; the intended caller is `integration/midnight-client.ts`'s `checkTreasuryHealth`.

**Important note (T51):** like Creator Escrow, `depositFees` here is real, tested, and correctly gated, but **never actually invoked by either tier's curve contract** in the shipped architecture — same reason (no cross-contract call mechanism exists to route the deposit here).

#### 4.6 CTO Governance PSM

**Purpose:** Community TakeOver ballots — proposal creation, private voting, quorum/majority enforcement, and executing the redirect once a vote passes. This PSM exists for all three tiers; Tier A also has a Cardano-native equivalent (`cto_governance.ak`, see Section 12) that serves as the anchor target and, for Tier A, the primary ballot mechanism directly.

**Corrected 2026-07-12 — this contract was previously missing from this document entirely.**

**State:**
- `launchId` (sealed), `creatorKey` (sealed), `totalSupply` (sealed), `creatorVoteCap` (sealed — an absolute token amount, e.g. 2% of supply, not a percentage computed at vote time)
- `ctoState` — PreCTO, CTOTriggered, CTODissolved
- `communityWallet`
- `lastCreatorActivity` — governor-attested, updated from off-chain monitoring (claim or social post detected)
- `hasClaimableBalance` — governor-attested (T36, 2026-07-12): whether the launch's fee escrow currently holds a real, unclaimed balance. Without this, a zero-volume launch (no trade fees ever accrued) could still have a `SilenceLockTrigger` proposal pass purely on elapsed time — there'd be nothing to actually recover. Refreshed together with `lastCreatorActivity` via the same governor call, since both facts come from the same off-chain observation.
- `balanceSnapshotRoot` — Merkle root of `(voterKey, balance)` leaves, published by the governor before any proposal can be created (design requirement, T53 — replaced a design where a voter's `voteWeight`/`isCreator` were trusted, caller-supplied values, so vote weight is proven, never asserted)
- `proposals` — map of proposal ID → Proposal (type, timestamps, vote tallies, state)
- `voteNullifiers` — prevents double-voting without revealing which voter voted
- `governorKey` (sealed)

**Circuits:**
1. `updateBalanceSnapshot(newRoot)` — governor-only; publishes the balance tree every `castVote` weight proof is checked against
2. `updateCreatorActivity(timestamp, hasClaimableBalance)` — governor-only; refreshes both silence-lock inputs together
3. `createProposal(proposalType, ...)` — anyone can propose; gates `SilenceLockTrigger` on both `lastCreatorActivity` exceeding the silence threshold **and** `hasClaimableBalance` being true (T36); gates other proposal types on `ctoState`/cooldown/post-graduation-delay as appropriate
4. `castVote(proposalId, support, currentTimestamp)` — requires a real Merkle proof of the voter's balance against `balanceSnapshotRoot`; creator's own vote weight is capped at `creatorVoteCap` (not excluded, not unlimited) and tracked separately (`creatorYesVotes`/`creatorNoVotes`) for public audit (T35/T41)
5. `finalizeProposal`/`executeProposal` — enacts a passed `SilenceLockTrigger` (sets `ctoState`/`communityWallet`) or `DissolveCTO` (returns control if the creator re-engages)
6. Read circuits: `getCtoState`, `getCommunityWallet`, `getLastCreatorActivity`, `getHasClaimableBalance`, `getProposal`, `hasVoted`, `getProposalCount`

**Cross-contract limitation (important):** this contract only ever flips its **own** `ctoState`/`communityWallet` when a proposal executes — it cannot call any other PSM's `triggerCTO` directly (no cross-contract call mechanism exists, T2/T25). Each dependent contract's own `triggerCTO` (Creator Escrow, Vesting, Treasury, both tiers' curve contracts) must be invoked as a separate, off-chain-orchestrated transaction — see `integration/midnight-client.ts`'s `executeCtoProposal`.

#### 4.7 Midnight LP Escrow PSM (Tier C only)

**Purpose:** 365-day LP lock with no withdraw and DEX migration, for **Tier C only**. Tier A and Tier B both use the Cardano `lp_escrow.ak` contract instead (see Section 12) — there is no Midnight LP Escrow PSM in their flow at all.

**State:**
- `launchId` (sealed), `lockTimestamp` (sealed), `lockDuration` (sealed)
- `lpState` — Locked, Migrated
- `dexWhitelist` — Set of approved DEX addresses (governor-updatable until the Midnight DEX landscape stabilizes, per T18/T20)
- `ctoTriggered`, `communityWallet` — same CTO pattern as every other PSM (T51 correction, see below)
- `governorKey` (sealed)

**Circuits:**
1. `sealLock(timestamp)` — Governor seals the lock start time
2. `addDexToWhitelist(dexAddr)` — Governor adds DEX to whitelist
3. `removeDexFromWhitelist(dexAddr)` — Governor removes DEX from whitelist
4. `migrateLp(dexAddr)` — Migrate LP to whitelisted DEX after lock expiry (Phase 3, 2026-07-12: no longer takes a caller-supplied timestamp — gates on real chain time via `blockTimeGte` directly)
5. `isLockExpired` — Check if lock has expired (same Phase 3 fix — no parameter)
6. `triggerCTO`/`dissolveCTO` — redirects LP trading-fee harvest authority to the community wallet after a passed CTO vote (added 2026-07-12, previously missing from this contract entirely — see the note below)
7. `getLpState` — Read LP state

**Key constraint:** `lockDuration` must be >= 31536000 (365 days). **No withdraw function exists.** The only way to move LP is `migrateLp` after lock expiry to a whitelisted DEX.

**Note:** this PSM is currently unreachable in practice — T18 (no Midnight DEX exists yet) means Tier C is build-blocked before this contract's `migrateLp` circuit would ever be exercised. Graduation for Tier C currently means "LP seeded into this escrow," full stop (Option C from T18), with the DEX component deferred.

**CTO fee-redirect fix (T51, 2026-07-12) — a gap that affected every tier:** until this fix, none of the three bonding curve contracts (`bonding_curve.ak` Tier A, `bonding_curve_tier_b.ak` Tier B, `bonding_curve.compact` Tier C) had any CTO concept at all — a passed `SilenceLockTrigger` vote never actually redirected the bonding-curve trade fee, regardless of what `cto_governance.compact`'s own logic did, because that contract only flips its own state (see 4.6's cross-contract limitation note). Fixed by adding the same `ctoTriggered`/community-wallet pattern `lp_escrow.ak` already used for its own trading-fee harvest (T13) to all three curve contracts, plus Creator Escrow, Vesting, and this Midnight LP Escrow PSM. Each contract's own `triggerCTO`/`dissolveCTO` (or `TriggerCTO`/`DissolveCTO` on Aiken) must still be called as a separate, off-chain-orchestrated transaction after a CTO vote passes — see `integration/midnight-client.ts`'s `executeCtoProposal`.

## 5. Cross-PSM Communication

> **Rewritten 2026-07-10.** This section previously claimed Compact supports "transaction merging" as a native mechanism for atomic multi-PSM state transitions. **That claim is false and has been retracted.** This session's T25 work compiled real probe contracts against the actual Compact compiler to test every call form between two deployed PSMs — all failed with "contract types are not yet implemented." No mechanism exists in Compact today, at any level (transaction, witness, or ledger), for one deployed PSM to read or write another deployed PSM's state atomically. This is a materially different (and more limiting) situation than the original version of this document described, and it directly shaped how Tier B and Tier C were architected — see below.

### What Actually Works: Compile-Time Contract Merging

The only mechanism that works is folding multiple `.compact` source files into **one deployed contract** at compile time, via `include`/`module` directives, before the Compact compiler ever runs. The result is a single contract with a single shared ledger — not two contracts communicating, but one contract that used to be described as several. There is no cross-PSM call at runtime because there is no longer a PSM boundary at all between the merged pieces.

This is exactly what T25 did for Tier C: `eligibility_gate.compact`'s cap-tracking logic, `darkveil.compact`'s registration/commitment/reveal logic, and the bonding curve's public-buy logic were merged into one file (`contracts/midnight/bonding_curve.compact`, Section 4.2) sharing one `cumulativePurchases` ledger. That is the *only* reason the 5% cumulative cap can be enforced atomically across DarkVeil and public-phase purchases for Tier C.

### What This Constraint Forced, Tier By Tier

- **Tier B (T24, T46):** rather than try to merge a Midnight bonding curve with the Midnight Eligibility Gate + DarkVeil logic, the public bonding curve was moved off Midnight entirely, onto Cardano/Aiken (`bonding_curve_tier_b.ak`). The public phase is public information by definition, so nothing about it needed Midnight's privacy — and Cardano can enforce quadratic-curve payment natively, the same pattern Tier A already used. The cumulative cap crosses the Midnight→Cardano boundary via a **relayer anchor**, not a cross-PSM call: at DarkVeil close, the relayer pushes a Merkle root over each registrant's private allocation to the Cardano ZK Anchor Contract (a root, not a plaintext list — T46, fixing a privacy leak the original anchor design had), and buyers later claim their real ADA-settled allocation on Cardano via `ClaimDarkVeilTokens`, which is also where the cap-tracking list actually gets populated (starting empty, not pre-seeded). Eligibility Gate and DarkVeil are still Midnight-only, but no longer two separate PSMs — Phase 2 (2026-07-11) merged them into one contract (`eligibility_gate.compact`), since there's no cross-contract call mechanism to let a standalone DarkVeil circuit and a standalone Eligibility Gate circuit coordinate the ratio-based NIGHT bond refund either.
- **Tier C (T25):** as described above — three-way compile-time merge into one contract.
- **Cross-contract payout that looks like a cross-PSM call but isn't (T33):** `claimRatioBondRefund` on the merged Tier C contract pays the forfeited portion of a forfeited NIGHT bond directly to fixed treasury/ops **addresses** via `sendUnshielded` — not to another contract's circuit. This works specifically because the destinations are known, fixed, real unshielded addresses, not another PSM's state that needs a circuit invoked on it. It is not evidence of a working cross-contract call; it's a case where the payout target happens not to need one.
- **Other multi-PSM-sounding flows** (fee deposits into Treasury, escrow deposits into Creator Escrow) are **not** atomic cross-PSM transactions either — each PSM's own circuit sends value directly to a fixed recipient address the same way, or the flow is a separate, individually-submitted transaction relying on the platform's off-chain orchestration layer to sequence them, with no on-chain atomicity guarantee across the two. Where atomicity actually matters (the 5% cap), the answer was always "merge the contracts," never "merge the transaction."

### T2's Cross-PSM Atomicity Question Is Now Answered, Not Just Defaulted

CLAUDE.md's T2 (DarkVeil PSM close → Bonding Curve PSM open) originally defaulted to a 10-minute settlement window pending confirmation from Midnight engineering on cross-PSM atomicity. That confirmation arrived indirectly, at the SDK level: `@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts`'s only transaction-batching primitive (`withContractScopedTransaction`) is parameterized by a single contract type and cannot batch calls across two different PSMs. Combined with T25's compiler-level finding above, the 10-minute settlement window isn't a conservative default anymore — it is currently the only implementable option, for the same underlying reason T24/T25 exist: nothing in Compact or the SDK lets two separate deployed contracts commit state atomically together.

## 6. Privacy Model

### What Goes On-Chain (Public Ledger)

| Data | Visibility | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| `launchId`, `dvAllocation`, `dvPrice` | Sealed at deploy | Transparency for launch parameters |
| `dvState` | Public | Phase transparency |
| `commitments` (hashes only) | Public | Enables verification without revealing content |
| `buyNullifiers` (hashes only) | Public | Prevents double-buying |
| `totalParticipants`, `totalTokensCommitted` | Public (aggregates) | Launch transparency |
| `fairLaunchCert` | Public | Proves fairness |
| `governorKey` | Public (derived) | Admin accountability |

### What Stays Private

| Data | Where | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| User's secret key | Witness (never on-chain) | Identity protection |
| Buy nonce | Witness (never on-chain) | Commitment uniqueness |
| Governor's secret key | Witness (never on-chain) | Admin security |
| Individual buy amounts | Hidden in commitments until revealed | Front-run protection |
| UserPublicKey → real identity | Off-chain mapping | Privacy by default |

### Privacy Flow

```
(Tier B: all four steps hit ONE contract, eligibility_gate.compact — merged
 2026-07-11, T63. Tier C: all four steps hit ONE contract, bonding_curve.compact
 — merged 2026-07-10, T25. Shown as separate steps below for clarity, not
 separate deployed contracts.)

1. Registration:
 User ──(ZK proof of allowlist membership)──▶ merged contract
 User ──(NIGHT bond lock)──────────────────▶ merged contract
 Identity: NOT revealed (nullifier only)

2. Buying (DarkVeil):
 User ──(commitment hash + nullifier)──────▶ merged contract
 Amount: HIDDEN in commitment
 Identity: NOT revealed (nullifier prevents double-buy)
 Requires proof of prior registration (T51) — closes a real gap where a
 wallet could previously buy without ever registering

3. Reveal (after close):
 User ──(private buy data via witness)─────▶ merged contract
 Amount: BECOMES PUBLIC (Tier C reveal; Tier B's real settlement instead
 happens on Cardano via ClaimDarkVeilTokens, T46 — see 4.1)
 Identity: Still protected by UserPublicKey abstraction

4. Certificate:
 Governor ──(closeDarkVeil)────────────────▶ merged contract
 Certificate: PUBLIC (aggregate stats only)
 Individual participation: NOT in certificate
```

---

## 7. Identity System

### Witness-Derived UserPublicKey

All Noctis PSMs use witness-derived identity instead of Midnight's `ownPublicKey`:

```
UserSecretKey (private, never on-chain)
 │
 ▼
persistentHash("noctis:<domain>:user:pk:v1", secretKey.bytes)
 │
 ▼
UserPublicKey (32-byte hash, used as on-chain identity)
```

**Why not `ownPublicKey`?**

`ownPublicKey` returns the transaction submitter's key, which is:
- Bypassable (can be set to any key)
- Not tied to a private secret
- Not domain-separated (same key across all contracts)

Witness-derived `UserPublicKey` is:
- Tied to a private secret (must know the secret to derive the key)
- Domain-separated (different key per contract domain)
- Non-bypassable (must provide the witness)

### Domain Separation

Each PSM uses a unique domain tag:

| Contract | Domain Tag |
|-----|-----------|
| Eligibility Gate (Tier B, merged with DarkVeil) | `noctis:eligibility:user:pk:v1` |
| Bonding Curve (Tier C, merged with Eligibility Gate + DarkVeil) | `noctis:curve:user:pk:v1` |
| Creator Escrow | `noctis:escrow:creator:pk:v1` |
| Vesting | `noctis:vesting:creator:pk:v1` |
| CTO Governance | `noctis:cto:user:pk:v1` |
| LP Escrow | `noctis:lp:governor:pk:v1` |
| Treasury | `noctis:treasury:governor:pk:v1` |

This prevents cross-PSM identity linking — a user's key in the bonding curve is different from their key in DarkVeil, even though both derive from the same secret.

---

## 8. Tokenomics

### Total Supply

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total supply | 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) |
| DarkVeil allocation | 10-20% (default 15%) |
| Bonding curve allocation | 80-90% (default 85%) |
| Staking rewards allocation | 25% fixed, optional per-launch toggle (T66, 2026-07-14) — see CLAUDE.md's STAKING REWARDS section |
| Per-wallet cap | 5% cumulative (DV + public) |

### Fee Structure

| Fee | Rate | Recipient |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Creator fee | 1.0% (100 bps) | Creator Escrow PSM |
| Treasury fee | 0.6% (60 bps) | Treasury PSM |
| Ops fee | 0.4% (40 bps) | Ops wallet (governor) |
| **Total** | **2.0% (200 bps)** | |

### NIGHT Bond

- **Amount:** $50 USD equivalent in NIGHT (default 100 NIGHT, configurable per launch)
- **Purpose:** Anti-spam + skin-in-the-game for DarkVeil registration
- **Full refund (`claimBondRefund`):** launch cancelled outright, or DarkVeil itself failed (<50% participation) — 100% returned to every registrant in both cases, no forfeiture.
- **Ratio-based refund (`claimRatioBondRefund`, T43):** DarkVeil closed normally. `NIGHT_returned = NIGHT_bonded × tokens_purchased / tokens_allocated` (floored on-chain, computed off-chain). Bought 100% of the flat per-registrant allocation (`baseSlot`) → full refund; bought 0% (ghost) → fully forfeited; anything between is proportional.
- **Forfeited-portion routing (T33):** the forfeited remainder (`bondAmount - claimedRefund`) is paid out in the SAME `claimRatioBondRefund` call — split 60% treasury / 40% ops (matching the launch-fee-split ratio), sent via `sendUnshielded` directly to fixed addresses set at deploy. Not a cross-PSM call — see §5 below on why that matters.

---

## 9. DarkVeil Protocol

### Phase Lifecycle

```
Inactive ──(startRegistration)──▶ Registration
 │
 │ (startBuying)
 ▼
 Buying
 │
 ┌──────────┼──────────┐
 │ │ │
 (closeDarkVeil) │ (cancelDarkVeil)
 │ │ │
 ▼ ▼ ▼
 Closed (stays) Cancelled
```

### Commitment-Based Buying

1. **Commit:** User computes `commitment = H(buyerKey, launchId, tokenAmount, pricePerToken, nonce)` and submits `commitment + nullifier` to DarkVeil PSM
2. **Hide:** The commitment hash is on-chain, but the inputs are private. Nobody can see the purchase amount or link it to identity.
3. **Prevent double-buy:** The nullifier `H(buyerKey, launchId)` is unique per (user, launch). Submitting it twice is rejected.
4. **Reveal:** After DarkVeil closes, users reveal their commitments by providing the private inputs via witnesses. The PSM recomputes the commitment hash and verifies ownership.
5. **Aggregate:** Revealed amounts update `totalTokensCommitted` and `totalRaisedCommitted`.

### ZK Fair Launch Certificate

When DarkVeil closes, the governor calls `closeDarkVeil(closeTimestamp)` which generates a `FairLaunchCert`:

```
FairLaunchCert {
 launchId: Bytes<32> // Which launch
 totalParticipants: Uint<64> // How many unique buyers
 totalTokensAllocated: Uint<128> // Total tokens sold in DarkVeil
 totalRaised: Uint<128> // Total raised in DarkVeil
 participationRate: Uint<8> // % of allowlist that participated
 closeTimestamp: Uint<64> // When DarkVeil closed
 certHash: Bytes<32> // Unique certificate hash
}
```

This certificate is:
1. **Public** — anyone can verify the DarkVeil was fair
2. **Anchored to Cardano** — stored in a Cardano ZK Anchor contract for permanence
3. **Non-repudiable** — the governor cannot modify it after generation

---

## 10. Bonding Curve Mathematics

Tier A and Tier B/C deliberately use **different curve shapes**, matching CLAUDE.md's tier design: Tier A is the "weak" tier (weak per-address cap, simple linear pricing, no Midnight dependency at all), and Tier B/C are the "strong" tier (strong ZK-identity cap via the Eligibility Gate PSM, plus a curve that accelerates faster the more of it one wallet buys — a second anti-whale mechanic layered on top of the cap). Do not treat one as a simplification of the other.

### Tier B/C — Quadratic Curve Formula

```
price = basePrice + k * tokensSold^2
 where k = (maxPrice - basePrice) / curveSupply^2
```

**Corrected 2026-07-10 (T24):** this quadratic shape is shared by Tier B and Tier C, but they no longer run on the same execution environment. Tier B's public curve is `contracts/cardano/bonding_curve_tier_b.ak` (Aiken, Cardano L1) — the DarkVeil phase before it is the only Midnight-side part of Tier B. Tier C's curve is the Midnight `bonding_curve.compact` merged contract (Section 4.2). Both verify the price via the same multiplication-invariant technique, for different underlying reasons — Aiken/Plutus doesn't forbid division but exact-integer verification is still preferable to rounding; Compact forbids in-circuit division outright:

```
price * curveSupply^2 == basePrice * curveSupply^2 + (maxPrice - basePrice) * tokensSold^2
```

The caller provides `claimedPrice` and the contract verifies this invariant holds (Tier C's Compact version casts to `Field` before squaring/cross-multiplying — `Uint<128> * Uint<128>` trips Compact's static overflow check even for realistic curve parameters). Same `k` derivation — i.e. same curve shape — for both Tier B and Tier C; the two differ only in `currency` (Ada vs Night) and execution environment, not steepness.

#### Example

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `basePrice` | 0.0001 ADA |
| `maxPrice` | 0.001 ADA |
| `curveSupply` | 850,000,000 (85% of 1B) |
| `priceRange` | 0.0009 ADA |

At 0% sold: price = 0.0001 ADA
At 50% sold: price = 0.0001 + 0.0009 × 0.5² = 0.000325 ADA
At 100% sold: price = 0.001 ADA (10x from start)

Note the quadratic shape stays near `basePrice` for longer and then accelerates — unlike a linear curve's constant rate of increase, which reaches the 50% price point at 50% sold rather than 32.5%.

### Tier A — Linear Curve Formula (Cardano/Aiken)

```
price = basePrice + (tokensSold / curveSupply) * (maxPrice - basePrice)
```

Verified the same way — a multiplication invariant, `price * curveSupply == basePrice * curveSupply + tokensSold * (maxPrice - basePrice)` — though Aiken/Plutus has no circuit-level division restriction, so this is a choice for exactness rather than a hard requirement. Lives in `contracts/cardano/bonding_curve.ak`, entirely separate from the Midnight PSM above; Tier A never touches Midnight.

With the same example parameters, at 50% sold: price = 0.0001 + 0.0009 × 0.5 = 0.00055 ADA — the straight-line midpoint, in contrast to Tier B/C's quadratic curve above.

### Graduation

**Corrected 2026-07-10 (T49).** When `tokensSold == curveSupply`, the curve transitions to `Graduated` state (still just a state flag set inside the buy circuit on the last purchase). What happens next was, for a while, an actual gap: none of `bonding_curve.ak`, `bonding_curve_tier_b.ak`, or the Midnight `bonding_curve.compact` had a code path that moved funds/tokens into the LP at all — `Graduated` was a flag nothing acted on. This is now resolved for Tier A/B via two new **permissionless** redeemers on the Aiken contracts (not a "merged transaction with LP Escrow PSM" — no such mechanism exists, see Section 5):
1. `Graduate` — verified by real value movement (correct ADA/token amounts leaving the curve contract for the LP Escrow contract), not by a signature. `LP ADA = total raised × 0.98` (net of the 2.0% running fee, T27).
2. `SealLock(timestamp, seeded_ada)` on `lp_escrow.ak` — starts the 365-day lock, verified against the actual amount the curve just seeded.
3. Fee withdrawal availability for governor/creator (`ClaimCreatorFees` etc.)
4. Creator escrow vesting start

Tier C's equivalent is LP seeding into the Midnight LP Escrow PSM (Section 4.6), currently unreachable pending T18.

---

## 11. Fee Routing

### Per-Buy Fee Split

```
grossPayment = tokenAmount * claimedPrice

creatorFee = grossPayment * 100 / 10000 (1.0%)
treasuryFee = grossPayment * 60 / 10000 (0.6%)
opsFee = grossPayment * 40 / 10000 (0.4%)
netPayment = grossPayment - creatorFee - treasuryFee - opsFee
```

### Fee Accumulators

**Corrected 2026-07-11:** which contract accrues each fee now depends on tier (T24/T46), and Treasury's balance is currency-split, not one number (T6).

| Accumulator | Contract | Withdrawal |
|-------------|-----|------------|
| `creatorFees` (Tier A) | `bonding_curve.ak` (Cardano) | Via that contract's own `ClaimCreatorFees` |
| `creatorFees` (Tier B, DarkVeil claim + public buy — ONE balance, T46) | `bonding_curve_tier_b.ak` (Cardano) — `creator_fees_accrued` field | Via that contract's own `ClaimCreatorFees` |
| `creatorFees` (Tier C) | merged `bonding_curve.compact` (Midnight) | Via Creator Escrow PSM equivalent circuit |
| `treasuryFees` | Treasury PSM — `adaBalance`/`nightBalance`, currency-split (T6) | Via Treasury PSM `withdrawFees(amount, currency, recipientAddr)` |
| `opsFees` | Same contract as the curve for that tier | Via that contract's own `withdrawFees` |

### Important: Two Distinct Income Streams

The creator has two separate income sources that are never combined. Tier B's Bonding Curve Escrow is ONE balance now (T46 supersedes T45's earlier "two Stream A1/A2 balances" — Stream A1 never actually accrued a real fee, since Compact could never enforce Tier B's ADA payment):

1. **Bonding Curve Escrow** — fixed amount raised during the curve (held in Creator Escrow and/or the curve contract itself depending on tier, vested over 90-365 days)
2. **LP Trading Fees** — ongoing fees from DEX trading post-graduation, harvested via `HarvestFees` (T13) — DEX-agnostic, verifies only that the Noctis-side LP position is untouched and the correct recipient was paid, not the DEX-specific harvest call itself

---

## 12. LP Lock and DEX Migration

> **Note (2026-07-10):** these design principles apply identically to both execution environments — Cardano's `lp_escrow.ak` (Tier A + B) and Midnight's LP Escrow PSM (Tier C only, Section 4.6) — but the two are separate contracts, not one shared mechanism. The flow below was written against the Compact PSM's circuit names (`sealLock`, `migrateLp`); the Cardano contract uses the equivalent redeemers (`SealLock`, `MigrateLp`, plus `Graduate` upstream of it — see Section 10's T49 correction) with the same invariants.

### Design Principles

1. **365-day minimum lock** — enforced at contract level (`lockDuration >= 31536000`)
2. **No withdraw function** — by design. There is no way to extract LP tokens. (Distinct from `ClaimBuyback`, T48 — see CLAUDE.md's Key Design Principles §5 — which only exists pre-graduation on a force-cancelled curve that never seeded an LP, and never touches `lp_escrow.ak`.)
3. **DEX migration only** — after lock expiry, LP can only move to a whitelisted DEX
4. **Governance-gated whitelist, resolved for real (T30, 2026-07-10):** the Cardano whitelist previously only required one governor signature with immediate effect, despite the contract's own file header already claiming "multisig + 72h notice." Now genuinely implemented as three redeemers: `ProposeDexChange` (requires `multisig_threshold`-of-`multisig_signers` real signatures, starts a 72h public-notice clock), `ExecuteDexChange` (permissionless once the notice period elapses — the public proposal window is itself the authorization, same idiom as `ExpireCurve`/`Graduate`), and `CancelPendingDexChange` (lets the multisig withdraw a proposal early).

### Migration Flow

```
LP Escrow Deployed
 │
 ▼
sealLock(timestamp) ──▶ Lock starts (365-day countdown)
 │ (Cardano Tier A/B: SealLock(timestamp, seeded_ada), called permissionlessly
 │ right after Graduate verifies real value moved into the LP — T49)
 │ Phase 3 fix (2026-07-12): timestamp is now bound to real chain time
 │ (blockTimeGte/blockTimeLte, ±1 hour) — a governor can no longer seal
 │ the lock with an artificially old timestamp to fast-forward expiry
 │
 │ ... 365 days pass (real chain time, not a claimed value) ...
 │
 ▼
isLockExpired ──▶ true
 │ Phase 3 fix: no longer takes a currentTimestamp parameter — reads
 │ blockTimeGte(lockTimestamp + lockDuration) directly
 │
 ▼
migrateLp(dexAddr)
 │ Phase 3 fix: no longer takes a currentTimestamp parameter either —
 │ same reasoning, removes the "any caller can claim expiry passed by
 │ lying about the time" gap entirely rather than just bounding it
 │
 ├─ Verify: lpState == Locked
 ├─ Verify: blockTimeGte(lockTimestamp + lockDuration)
 ├─ Verify: dexAddr in dexWhitelist (whitelist changes now gated by T30's multisig+72h flow above)
 │
 ▼
lpState = Migrated
 │
 ▼
LP tokens move to DEX (via Zswap layer on Midnight; direct DEX interaction on Cardano)
```

## 13. ZK Fair Launch Certificate

### Purpose

The ZK Fair Launch Certificate proves that a DarkVeil phase was conducted fairly, without revealing individual participation details. It is:

- **Publicly verifiable** — anyone can check the certificate hash
- **Anchored to Cardano** — stored permanently on Cardano L1
- **Aggregate only** — contains totals, not individual records

### Certificate Generation

The certificate is generated when the governor calls `closeDarkVeil(closeTimestamp)`:

```compact
certHash = persistentHash(launchId, totalParticipants, totalTokensAllocated, totalRaised, closeTimestamp)
```

### Cardano Anchor

For Tier B and C launches, the certificate is anchored to Cardano via an Aiken ZK Anchor contract that:
1. Stores the certificate hash permanently
2. Allows anyone to verify the certificate matches on-chain DarkVeil data
3. Serves as a permanent public record of launch fairness

---

## 14. Cardano Integration

### Blockfrost Integration

- **Purpose:** Cardano L1 indexing (UTXOs, transactions, asset metadata)
- **Primary:** Blockfrost API
- **Fallback:** Maestro, Koios
- **Usage:** Token minting, DEX interaction, LP escrow management

### Orcfax Oracle Integration

- **Purpose:** ADA/USD price feed for NIGHT bond calculation
- **Primary:** Orcfax oracle
- **Secondary:** Minswap TWAP
- **Usage:** Convert $50 USD bond requirement to NIGHT amount at registration time

### DEX Graduation

- **Default DEX:** CSwap
- **Whitelist:** Minswap, Splash, Spectrum
- **Selection:** Creator chooses at launch wizard
- **LP Pair:** Token/ADA (Tier A/B) or Token/NIGHT (Tier C, when available)

### Real off-chain DarkVeil eligibility checks (T8/T65, 2026-07-12)

`integration/eligibility-checker.ts` implements checks #1 (wallet age ≥ 90 days) and #5 (no direct ADA flow from creator, 90-day lookback) for real, against live Blockfrost data — `checkWalletAge` walks an address's full transaction history to find its earliest activity; `checkNoDirectAdaFlow` scans a registrant's transactions in the lookback window and fetches each one's real inputs/outputs to check whether the creator's address appears on either side. These are meant to run over every DarkVeil applicant **before** the platform builds the allowlist Merkle tree the merged Eligibility Gate/DarkVeil contract (4.1) verifies membership against — see Section 6 for the corrected privacy model this implies. Check #2 (NIGHT balance) is confirmed achievable via `midnight-indexer`'s `unshieldedTransactions` subscription but not yet built; check #4 (stake key match) needs real cross-chain proof machinery that doesn't exist yet.

### N-Hop Challenge Contract (T9, 2026-07-12 — Tier B only, Cardano-side)

`contracts/cardano/validators/nhop_challenge.ak` is a new standalone Cardano validator implementing CLAUDE.md's N-hop Sybil challenge window. It lives on Cardano rather than as an eighth Midnight PSM because its reporter bond is ADA-denominated — the same cross-chain reasoning that moved Tier B's public curve to Cardano (T24) applies here. It triggers after a registrant's real Cardano wallet becomes public via their `ClaimDarkVeilTokens` call (4.1/T46), not at registration, for the same privacy reason described throughout this document: nobody's real wallet is linked to DarkVeil participation until they claim. One UTXO per challenge, no continuing datum (resolution is a terminal spend); governor-adjudicated (the underlying transaction-graph evidence can't be verified inside a script); pays the challenger's 25 ADA bond back in full if upheld, or splits it 60/40 treasury/ops if rejected. Tier C is unaffected — it's already fully build-blocked independent of this feature (T17/T18/T19/T20).

## 15. DIDz Ecosystem Integration

Noctis is part of the DIDz ecosystem, a suite of privacy-preserving identity and application tools built on Midnight Network.

### Three-Pillar Model

| Pillar | Role in Noctis |
|--------|---------------|
| **DIDz** (root identity) | Traders hold a DIDz; Noctis verifies allowlist membership via ZK proofs without revealing identity |
| **AgenticDID** (agent authority) | Creators can delegate scoped authority to agents for launch management (e.g., allowlist updates, phase transitions) |
| **RWAz** (object identity) | Asset verification for real-world asset tokens launched on Noctis (prove ownership without revealing the asset) |

### midnight-modules Reuse

| Module | Noctis PSM | How It's Used |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| `access-control` | All PSMs | Admin/governor pattern for circuit authorization |
| `commitment-nullifier` | DarkVeil, Bonding Curve | Double-spend prevention for buy orders, NIGHT bond locking |
| `merkle-membership` | Eligibility Gate | Allowlist verification without revealing identity |
| `oracle-attestation` | Bonding Curve | Orcfax price feed verification for ADA/NIGHT conversion |
| `liveness-timer` | Creator Escrow, LP Escrow | Vesting schedule enforcement, escrow time locks |

## 16. SilentLedger Architecture Mapping

SilentLedger is a privacy-preserving orderbook DApp on Midnight. Its three contracts map directly to Noctis PSMs:

### AssetVerification → Eligibility Gate

| SilentLedger | Noctis | Reused Pattern |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| ZK ownership proof | ZK allowlist membership proof | Prove eligibility without revealing identity |
| Composite key hashing | Cumulative purchase tracking | Flatten (owner, asset) → single key |
| Replay prevention via proof hash | Double-registration prevention via nullifier | One-time use of proofs |

### SilentOrderbook → DarkVeil

| SilentLedger | Noctis | Reused Pattern |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| Commitment-based orders | Commitment-based buy orders | Hide order details in hash |
| ownerHash privacy | UserPublicKey privacy | Identity not revealed |
| Match/cancel lifecycle | Submit/cancel/reveal lifecycle | Order state machine |
| Batch root updates | ZK Fair Launch Certificate | Aggregate state commitment |

### ObfuscatedOrderbook → Bonding Curve

| SilentLedger | Noctis | Reused Pattern |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| Price-tagged orders | Price-verified buys | Price attached to each order |
| Fill matching | Graduation trigger | Complete when fully matched |
| Sell-side verification gating | Cap enforcement via eligibility gate | Gate before allowing action |

## 17. Data Flow Diagrams

### Tier B Launch (End-to-End)

> **Corrected 2026-07-10 (T24/T49/T30).** Steps 4, 12, and 13 previously described a Midnight-side bonding curve and a "merged transaction" cap check — neither exists. Updated to match the real split: Midnight for DarkVeil only, Cardano for everything public.

Participants

 ├──(7) Register for DarkVeil

 │
 ├──(9) DarkVeil closes
 │ • Governor calls closeDarkVeil
 │ • ZK Fair Launch Certificate generated
 │ • Relayer anchors the certificate + a dv_allocation_root — a Merkle

 │ NOT a plaintext list (T46 — the pre-T46 design published every

 │
 ├──(10) Reveal buy commitment
 │ • Provide private buy data via witnesses
 │ • PSM recomputes commitment, verifies ownership
 │ • Amount becomes part of this Midnight contract's own on-chain
 │ ledger state (inherent to commit/reveal — unrelated to T46, and
 │ unchanged by it). NO ADA moves here — Compact can't custody ADA.
 │
 ├──(11) Claim DarkVeil tokens (Cardano, bonding_curve_tier_b.ak — T46)
 │ • Buyer presents their own (dv_amount, salt, merkle_proof), proven
 │ against the anchored dv_allocation_root
 │ • Pays dv_amount * base_price in real ADA, receives the tokens
 │ • Nullified in dv_claimed so it can't be claimed twice
 │ • Rejected if buyer == creator (T32)
 │ • This is where the cap-tracking list actually gains its first
 │ entry for this wallet — it started empty at deploy
 │
 ├──(12) Public bonding curve (Cardano, bonding_curve_tier_b.ak)
 │ • Buy tokens at quadratic price, tokens mint directly to buyer
 │ • 5% cap enforced against the SAME list step 11 populates — a
 │ normal Cardano contract check, not a cross-chain or cross-PSM call
 │ • Rejected if buyer == creator (T32, closed the same gap Tier B's
 │ public curve previously had)
 │ • Fees split: 1.0% creator / 0.6% treasury / 0.4% ops — ONE balance
 │ now (T46 supersedes T45's earlier two-stream description)
 │
 ├──(13) Graduation (T49)
 │ • tokensSold == curveSupply
 │ • Anyone calls Graduate — verified by real value movement, not a
 │ signature; moves LP ADA/tokens from the curve into lp_escrow.ak
 │ • Anyone calls SealLock(timestamp, seeded_ada) — starts the
 │ 365-day lock, verified against what Graduate actually seeded
 │ • Creator escrow vesting starts
 │
 └──(14) Post-graduation
 • Trading on DEX; pool fees harvested via HarvestFees (T13)
 • Creator claims vested amounts (90-365 days) and Stream A2 fees
 via ClaimCreatorFees on the Cardano curve contract
 • Governor withdraws treasury fees
 • After 365 days + T30's multisig+72h proposal: LP migrates to a
 newly-whitelisted DEX

## 18. Failure Paths

### DarkVeil Underparticipation (T22, resolved 2026-07-09 — corrected here 2026-07-10)

**Corrected:** this used to describe a governor-discretion `cancelDarkVeil` outcome. The real, resolved design is **Option B, not discretionary**: if DarkVeil fails (below the 50% participation threshold), the launch automatically **converts to a Tier-A-equivalent public launch** — it does not die. The bonding curve opens immediately without ever running a DarkVeil phase, priced from the same P₀ DarkVeil would have used. The creator loses the privacy phase but the launch stays alive: no partial launch-fee refund, no restart cooldown.

**Trigger:** participation measured against the 50% threshold at `T + 24h` (DarkVeil close); governor calls `markDarkVeilFailed` (Tier C — a dedicated ledger flag, independent of `phase`, added by T43 specifically because the original `phase == Cancelled` gate couldn't represent "converted to public, not cancelled").

**Consequences:**
- Launch `phase` → `Public` (not `Cancelled`) — the bonding curve proceeds
- All NIGHT bonds become **fully** refundable (100% — DarkVeil's "phase failed → 100% returned, no forfeiture" rule) via `claimBondRefund`, which since T43 actually pays out via `sendUnshielded` rather than only clearing the ledger
- Buy commitments that were never revealed simply have no effect — no tokens were allocated from the failed DarkVeil phase
- Full cancellation (curve never opens at all) is a separate, narrower path reserved for confirmed fraud or regulatory intervention — see Bonding Curve Cancellation below

### Bonding Curve Cancellation

**Trigger:** Governor calls `cancelCurve` — used when:
- DarkVeil reveals show fraud
- Regulatory intervention
- Technical failure before graduation

**Consequences:**
- Curve state → `Cancelled`
- No further buys possible
- Existing buyers retain their token balances
- Fees remain in accumulators (governor can withdraw)

### Stalled Curve Timeout + Principal Buyback (T29 + T48, added 2026-07-10)

This subsection didn't exist in the original document — it covers a real gap found and closed this session: 100%-sell-through-only graduation means a curve stuck at 95-99% sold sat in perpetual limbo with no timeout and no way to recover the ADA/NIGHT already raised.

**Trigger:** `MAX_CURVE_DURATION_DAYS` (90 days, platform constant) elapses on a curve still `Active` and not `Graduated`. Anyone (not just the governor) can then call `ExpireCurve` — permissionless by design, verified purely against the deadline having passed, same idiom as `Graduate` and T30's `ExecuteDexChange`: the passage of time is itself the authorization, no signer needed.

**Consequences:**
- Curve state → `Expired`
- **Tier A/B (T48, Option A — pro-rata buyback):** a new `ClaimBuyback` redeemer lets each token holder return their curve tokens to reclaim a proportional share of the stranded ADA still sitting in the curve contract. This is principal recovery, not a trading exit — it only exists pre-graduation on a curve that never seeded an LP. It does not touch LP tokens, does not exist on `lp_escrow.ak`, and must not be confused with LP withdrawal (which does not exist anywhere in the protocol — see CLAUDE.md's Key Design Principles §5).
- **Tier C:** no buyback redeemer yet — timeout mechanism (`ExpireCurve`-equivalent) is implemented, but T48's Option A was scoped to Tier A/B only; a Tier C equivalent is unbuilt.

### LP Escrow Edge Cases

**Lock never sealed:** If governor never calls `sealLock`, the lock timestamp remains 0. `isLockExpired` will return true once real chain time passes `0 + 31536000` (Phase 3, 2026-07-12: this now reads real chain time via `blockTimeGte`, not a caller-supplied claim), but `migrateLp` requires governor authorization, so LP is effectively frozen until governor acts.

**DEX not whitelisted:** If no DEX is whitelisted when lock expires, LP remains locked until governor adds a DEX to the whitelist. This is by design — it forces conscious DEX selection.
