// T42: proves eligibility_gate.compact's verifyAllowlist() actually
// enforces Merkle membership now (previously a placeholder accepting any
// non-zero leaf) — both that real proofs are accepted, and that every
// tampered variant of a proof is rejected. This is the highest-stakes
// piece of Compact code from this pass (a soundness bug here would mean
// the allowlist doesn't actually gate anything), so coverage here is
// deliberately adversarial, not just happy-path.
//
// Security-audit fix (the design requirement, 2026-07-11): the leaf is no longer a free
// witness (getAllowlistLeaf) — verifyAllowlist derives it in-circuit as
// hashAllowlistLeaf(caller), closing the "borrow someone else's leaf+proof"
// impersonation gap a free witness value allowed. Every test below builds
// its tree from REAL derived registrant identities (deriveUserPublicKey),
// not arbitrary opaque leaves, and drives the contract with the matching
// getUserSecret witness rather than a supplied leaf.
